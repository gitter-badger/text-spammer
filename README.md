# bee-movie-spammer

This program will type the entire bee movie script (emulating the keyboard) onto the platform of your choice. It will press enter after every line of text, so it can spam-send messages. Please make any improvements that you can think of either on a new branch or in the errors tab on github.com.


Basically, it just emulates the keyboard typing the text file 'beemoviescript.txt' and pressing return after every line. Nothing fancy.
