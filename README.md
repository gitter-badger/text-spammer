# Text typer

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f8b9505eb05842829a37d50ca669f6c7)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/ilikecheesybread/text-spammer?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ilikecheesybread/text-spammer&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This program will type the entire 'source.txt' file (emulating the keyboard) onto the platform of your choice. It will press enter after every line of text, so it can spam-send messages. Please make any improvements that you can think of either on a new branch or in the errors tab on github.com.

Basically, it just emulates the keyboard typing the text file 'source.txt' and pressing return after every line. Nothing fancy.
